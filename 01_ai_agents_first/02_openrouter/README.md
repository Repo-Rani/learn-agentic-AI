🌐 What is OpenRouter?

OpenRouter is your one-stop shop for accessing tons of large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, and more — all through a single, slick API. No need to juggle multiple platforms or rewrite code for every model. Just plug in, switch models, and roll! 🚀

🔥 Why OpenRouter Rocks

Here’s what makes OpenRouter a game-changer for developers:

✅ One API, Endless Models

Access 200+ models (from big names like OpenAI to open-source gems like LLaMA) with one unified API. Swap models by just tweaking the API key and base URL — no code overhaul needed. Time saved, headaches gone!

✅ Smart Routing, Smarter Results

OpenRouter picks the best model for your task based on:

Cost: Cheapest option to keep your budget happy.
Speed: Fastest response for snappy apps.
Availability: Always-on models to avoid downtime.
This means your app runs smoother, faster, and cheaper!
✅ Chatroom & Dashboard

Not a developer? No problem! OpenRouter’s web-based chatroom lets you talk to models directly. Plus, the dashboard tracks:

Token usage,
Costs,
API keys and account details.
Everything you need, all in one place.
🛠 Developer’s Dream API

OpenAI Compatible: Already using OpenAI’s Chat Completion API? Just update the base URL and API key, and you’re good to go. Zero fuss!
Function Calling: Build smarter apps with models that can call external tools (think weather APIs, search engines, etc.) mid-conversation.
🌍 How It Works: The Proxy Magic

OpenRouter doesn’t host models itself. It’s a super-smart proxy that:

Takes your API request,
Sends it to the right model provider (OpenAI, Mistral, etc.),
Delivers the response back to you.
This keeps things lightweight, fast, and hassle-free, with OpenRouter handling all the heavy lifting behind the scenes.
🎯 Why Choose OpenRouter?

Saves Time: One API for all models = less coding chaos.
Saves Money: Smart routing picks cost-effective models.
Super Flexible: Works for developers and non-coders alike.
