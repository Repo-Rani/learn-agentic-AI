# 🤖 Learn Agentic AI

Welcome to **Learn Agentic AI**, a hands-on playground for exploring the future of intelligent, autonomous systems. This project combines cutting-edge tools like **OpenAI SDK**, **Swarm**, **OpenRouter**, **LiteLLM**, and **Chainlit** to build and experiment with **AI agents** that can reason, plan, and interact intelligently.

---

## 🚀 What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI systems can:
- Think autonomously
- Make decisions
- Collaborate with other agents
- Interact with APIs, UIs, or humans
- Learn from feedback or results

This repo is your practical lab to test those concepts in action.
